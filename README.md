# OPMthis
_Application to test OPM algorithms on real event streams_

## Background
_OPMThis_ can be used to mine even streams. It is meant to serve as a basic application that can be extended towards
- Other sources
- Other OPM algorithms
- Other process diagrams
- Other UIs
- Other use-cases in general

To make OPMThis work, this pipeline needs to be in place:
