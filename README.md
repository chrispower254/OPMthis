# OPMthis
_Application to test OPM algorithms on real event streams_

## Background
_OPMThis_ can be used to mine even streams. It is meant to serve as a basic application that can be extended towards
- Other sources
- Other OPM algorithms
- Other process diagrams
- Other UIs
- Other use-cases in general

To make OPMThis work, this pipeline needs to be in place:

The different pipeline modules are supposed to be as independent from each other as possible. This first base version runs with the following setup:

This application is structured as the following:
